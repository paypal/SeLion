  - Annotation based WebDriver session management. 
  - Runtime Reporter for real-time test execution status. 
  - Swap out browser targets at run-time. 
  - Automate native, hybrid, and web applications on iOS and Android devices.
  - and more 
- A set of TestNG compatible data providers which allows you to access test data from 
  Excel, YAML, JSON, and XML.
- A maven archetype for creating new SeLion based projects. 
- A customized Selenium Grid2 component. 
- A Code generator Maven plugin for generating Java "page objects" out of YAML.
