    How to hook into element events provided by SeLion.
  </p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SeLion element events are primarily those which are related to some action that you perform through elements provided by SeLion such as "click" (or) "select" etc.

  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started with Element Event Handling in SeLion</h2>

  <p>
    SeLion offers support to hook into events that are generated by SeLion elements. These steps can be followed to start hooking into
    events using SeLion. As an example we are going to create a <code>DebugScreenshotListener</code> which takes a screenshot and adds it to the report before any element is clicked on.
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new listener class by implementing the SeLion exposed interface
        <code>ElementEventListener</code>. Or extend the <code>AbstractElementEventListener</code> if you don't want to implement all methods.
        <pre data-src="../sample-files/MyElementEventListener.java"></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Provide the fully qualified class name of your listener via one of the following ways:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The JVM argument <code>SELION_ELEMENENT_EVENT_LISTENER</code>
          <pre><code class="language-sh">-DSELION_ELEMENT_EVENT_LISTENER=com.paypal.test.listeners.DebugScreenshotListener</code></pre></li>
        <li>As a TestNG suite file parameter <code>elementEventListener</code>.
          <pre data-src="../sample-files/events-sample2.xml"></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      If you have more than one listener that you would want to plug in, then provide them as comma separated values.
    </ol>
  </p>
