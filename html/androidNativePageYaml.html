  <h1 class="page-header">PageYAML for Android app automation</h1>

  <p class="lead">This section is focused on SeLion PageYAML to facilitate automation for
    Android apps. Concepts outlined in this section build on those described in <a href="#pageyaml">SeLion PageYAML for
    web flow</a>.</p>
   
  <h2>Contents of a PageYAML File</h2>

  <p>A PageYAML file that represents a page (or screen) in an Android application is made up of the following parts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>baseClass</code> - The value for this key represents the fully qualified name of a class that will
      serve as the base class to inherit attributes and/or capabilities from. If your page is new and is not
      customizing an existing page, then you should specify the value 
      <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.AndroidPage</code> which by default is the class within SeLion 
      that provides all the basic operations that are required for any given Android page, including instantiation logic.
    </li>
    <li><code>platform</code> - The value for this key represents the platform the YAML is intended for.
     By default, if nothing is specified it is taken as "web". For Android platform it must be specified as "android".
     </li>
    <li><code>elements</code> - The value for this key is a set of key/value pairs that represent elements in a page.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>A unique name for identifying a particular element and type in the page. This name would end up as the name 
          of the member variable of the generated class and maps to the element. The rules for naming locators/selectors 
          are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UiObject for basic UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UiButton for Button UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UiTextView for Text View UI element.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here <strong>prefix</strong> would be a concise, contextual and meaningful name of your choice.</p>
      </li>
      <p>The list of supported Android elements can be found 
         <a href="java-docs/client-apis/com/paypal/selion/platform/mobile/android/package-summary.html" 
         alt="List of supported android elements">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>For including Android custom elements refer to the section <b>Configuration Parameters for Customizing the Code
        Generator Maven Plugin</b> as described in <a href="#what-is-code-generator">SeLion Code Generator</a>. 
      </p>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>An Example PageYAML File for an Android application</h2>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-androidnativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>Some important things to reiterate from this example:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><code>baseClass</code> value for the Android Native app automation must be 
       <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.AndroidPage</code> or a class which extends it.
   </li>
   <li><code>platform</code> value must be specified as <strong>android</strong>. This value is mandatory. 
       Otherwise, <a href="#pageyaml">web</a> is assumed.</li>
   <li>The suffix of all the elements must be a valid element name as per the platform. 
       In the above YAML file a button is represented using 
       <code>UiObject</code> and the element name is given as <code>shortPressButtonUiObject</code> 
       which is a valid one.</li>
  </ul>
