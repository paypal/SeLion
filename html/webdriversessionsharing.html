    How to share local and remote (on a Grid) web sessions in SeLion.
  </p>
    <p>
    Session sharing is a mechanism built into SeLion that allows a session to be shared between two or more tests
    running sequentially. When requested, a WebDriver session that is created in one test can be kept open and
    reused in a following test.</p>

  <h2>Steps to Share WebDriver Sessions Between Tests</h2>   <ol>
<li>Annotate the test class with <code>@Test</code> and <code>@WebTest</code>.
Set the attribute <code>singleThreaded = true</code>. The
methods of this class are executed sequentially with the same WebDriver
session. You can now use the <code>priority</code> attribute to order
the test method execution sequence.

     </li>

     <li>To start test session in a test method, annotate the test with <code>@Test</code>
        and use the attribute <code>priority = 1</code>.

      <pre data-src="../sample-files/webdriversessionsharing-sample2.java"></pre>

    <li>To pick up the same test session in a different test, annotate the test with <code>@Test</code>
        and use the <code>priority</code> greater than defined in the master test. This will reuse the same session in this test 
        instead of creating a new session. Since these tests order of execution controlled by TestNG priority.
        <p class="alert-info">Note: It is a good practice to keep these tests in the same group.</p>

      Here is a complete example that shows how a typical test would look:

      <pre data-src="../sample-files/webdriversessionsharing-sample4.java"></pre>
      Sessions can be shared to any number of <code>@Test</code> methods as long as they are running sequentially.
      Here is an example where the session is shared across three <code>@Test</code> methods.
