  <p class="lead">How to setup and use SeLion's Enhanced Grid.</p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The SeLion client component is compatible with any <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Selenium Grid2</a>.
      That said, we have also published our own enhanced grid as the server component of SeLion. At a high level in includes a
      few plug-ins to make managing and setting up your own grid a bit easier.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dependency Downloader - Download Selenium dependencies -- the jars, various drivers, etc at startup.</li>
    <li>Auto Upgrade Nodes – Upgrade the Selenium, IE Driver, Chrome Driver,
        PhantomJS binary in each node without impacting existing test case execution.</li>
    <li>Force Restart Node – Forcibly restart the node without logging in to the
        physical node.</li>
    <li>Self-Healing – Recycles the node after a pre-defined number of unique sessions are finished to avoid unexpected issues.
    Defaults to 50. Configurable via <code>$SELION_HOME/config/SeLionConfig.json</code></li>
    <li>View Node Logs – Grid provides the ability to view all the registered node log files</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>Install the following software on your grid machines:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java
      JDK 1.7</a> and configure the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable on your system</li>
    <li>If you <a href="#buildingSelion">compiled SeLion</a> locally, copy the <code>SeLion-Grid.jar</code> file of
      SeLion's Enhanced Grid from <code>server/target/</code> and paste it to your working folder. Otherwise, you can obtain it
      <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/paypal/selion/SeLion-Grid/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/">here</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="start-selion-grid">Start the Grid Hub</h2>
  <p>The grid hub serves as the central point. It will receive all test case requests from all
      clients and distribute them to the nodes registered with the grid.</p>
  <p>Open the command prompt and navigate to the location of the grid jar file. Type in the following command:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-sh">java -jar SeLion-Grid.jar -role hub</code></pre>

  <p>
      The grid hub will start up using the port <var>4444</var> by default. You can view it by connecting
      to <kbd>http://localhost:4444</kbd> with your preferred browser. By default all the required files will be downloaded or 
      extracted to <var>&lt;user.home&gt;/.selion</var> directory. To specify the different directory configure system property
      <code>-DselionHome=&lt;folderPath&gt;</code> to the java process.
  </p>

  <h2 id="start-selion-node">Start the Grid Node</h2>
  <p>The grid node will execute the test cases.</p>
  <p>Open the command prompt and navigate to the location of the grid jar file. Type in the following command:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-sh">java -jar SeLion-Grid.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register</code></pre>

  <p>
      The grid node will start up using the port <var>5555</var> by default. Once it is started,
      it will register with the grid hub. You can view the node detail in the
      grid console at <kbd>http://localhost:4444/grid/console</kbd>. Option <var>-hub</var> which represents SeLion Grid URL.
  </p>

  <p>The grid console should look like the following screen shot:</p>

  <div class="container">
      <img src="../images/grid-console.jpg" alt="View of the Grid console">
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>
      <b>Note:</b> The example shown uses the same machine for both the grid and the node. But you can spawn any
      number of nodes (one node per machine) and register them to a central grid hub.
  </p>

  <h2>Using the SeLion's Enhanced Grid to Run Tests</h2>
  <p>
      To learn how to create a web based test, refer to <a href="#getting-started">Getting
      Started With SeLion</a>.
  </p>
  <p>To run tests against the grid you spawned, update the following in your TestNG <samp>SampleSuite.xml</samp> file</p>
  <ol>
      <li><code>runLocally</code> - Indicates that SeLion should use a remote grid</li>
      <li><code>seleniumhost</code> - Points to the IP/machine name where the grid hub is running.</li>
  </ol>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/selionGrid-sample1.xml" data-line="5-8" class="line-numbers"></pre>

  <p>Now run the following command in the project directory path from a command prompt.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-sh">mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/resources/SampleSuite.xml</code></pre>

  <p>A browser window will open on the machine where your node is running.</p>

  <h2>Grid Management Console</h2>
  <p>
      If you have a large grid, managing the nodes can become tedious. The Enhanced Grid management console
      allows you to force restart and auto upgrade nodes. Navigate to the management console
      via the url <kbd>http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/LoginServlet</kbd> to manage
      the nodes. Default username and password is <kbd>admin</kbd>. Once logged in you will see this page:
  </p>

    <img src="../images/grid-management-console.jpg" alt="View of the SeLion Grid Management Console">
  </div>

  <h2 id="selion-config">SeLion Grid Configuration File</h2>
  <p>
    The SeLion Grid Configuration JSON file allows Grid to load the default properties. File available in
    <code>$SELION_HOME/config/SeLionConfig.json</code>. Default JSON file will be overrided by <code>-selionConfig</code> argument.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>restartCycle - Restart cycle will check specified interval to start the server if it is down. Units in milliseconds.</li>
    <li>uniqueSessionCount – Number of unique session completion node will be recycled.</li>
    <li>customProcessHandler – Process handler will be used to identify and kill the child processes spawned by node. Handler should
    implement interface <code>com.paypal.selion.utils.process.ProcessHandler</code></li>
    <li>artifactMaxFileSize – Maximum file size of the artifact which can be uploaded in to SeLion Grid repository. Units in bytes.</li>
    <li>artifactExpiryInMilliSec – Artifact will be removed from repository after the expiration time.</li>
    <li>managedArtifact – ManagedArtifact represents a basic artifact successfully saved to SeLion grid by an HTTP POST method call. It
     should implement interface <code>com.paypal.selion.grid.servlets.transfer.ManagedArtifact</code></li>
    <li>managedCriteria – Criteria implementation uses artifact name, user id and application folder to uniquely identify a managed artifact. It
     should implement interface <code>com.paypal.selion.grid.servlets.transfer.Criteria</code></li>
  </ol>
