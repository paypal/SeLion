  <p class="lead">The class <code>SimpleExcelDataProvider</code> is a utility class within SeLion that helps in reading test data from Excel spreadsheets so
    they may be used in data driven tests.</p>
  <p>Lets look at a basic example to see how to use the SimpleExcelDataProvider</p>
  <p>First create an Excel sheet similar to the following sample:</p>

  <div class="container">
    <img src="../images/exceldataprovider-sample1.jpg" alt="View of the Excelsheet">
  </div>

  <p>Here the row 1 includes the variable names. The following rows contain the values for those variable names.</p>
  <p>The first column, containing the keys, is compulsory but does not contain actual test data. It is used to get
    specific rows from the sheet. The title can be anything we choose</p>
  <p>To read from the Excel sheet you need to define a <code>@DataProvider</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code>@DataProvider</code> looks like the following:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample1.java"></pre>

  <p>Lets go through it.</p>
  <p>We first instantiate the SimpleExcelDataProvider with the location of the Excel file that we want to use. There is also
    an alternative constructor available that allows us to specify the directory and filename separately.</p>
  <p>The next step is to define the class into which we want to read the data from the Excel sheet. In this case we want
    to read the data into objects of the class <samp>MyDataSheet</samp>. We will show you the class in the next step. An
    object of this class is passed to the <code>getAllExcelRows()</code> method.</p>
  <p>The response from the <code>getAllExelRows()</code> method is an <code>Object[][]</code> that is returned by the
    data provider and consumed by the test method.</p>
  <p>The <samp>MyDataSheet</samp> class looks the following:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample2.java"></pre>

  <p>Keep in mind that the variables need to be defined with the exact same names and in the exact same order as the Excel
    sheet.</p>
  <p>The test method looks like the following:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample3.java"></pre>

  <p>So now that we can read all the rows, lets look at the methods that allow us to read specific rows</p>
  <p>Lets start with <code>getSingleExcelRow()</code>. This method takes two parameters, one of which is the key</p>
  <p>Lets also assume the Excel sheet is slightly different:</p>

  <div class="container">
    <img src="../images/exceldataprovider-sample1.jpg" alt="View of the Excelsheet">
  </div>

  <p>Here we have changed the first column to use keys to specify particular rows</p>
  <p>The <code>@DataProvider</code> method will look as follows:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample4.java"></pre>

  <p>In this case we asked for the row with the key 'c' and stored its values in the object myData. We then created the
    <code>Object[][]</code> that is the return type of the method.</p>
  <p>The test method does not change at all.</p>
  <p>We can change a single line and ask for the row by the order in which it appears instead of specifying the key. For
    example the <code>getSingleExcelRow()</code> could have been invoked as follows:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample5.java"></pre>

  <p>This would return the second row in the Excel sheet. This is specified as 1 because it is the first data row.
    Remeber that the very first row of the Excel sheet contains the variable names and not actual test data and
    therefore we start counting from below it.</p>
  <p>SimpleExcelDataProvider provides two <code>getExcelRows()</code> variants that can be used to get multiple rows depending
    on the conditions we set.</p>
  <p>The first of these methods allows us to specify the indexes of the Excel rows that we want. It is used as
    follows:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample6.java"></pre>

  <p>Observe that we have specified a range of rows to be used. in this case rows 1 through 3. We could also have
    specified the specific rows as "1, 2, 3". SimpleExcelDataProvider even lets you specify the rows as a combination of the
    two methods. Our example Excel sheet is not long enough but we could have specified the rows as follows
    "1-3,4,6,8,10-12", getting the rows 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,11,12</p>
  <p>The second method allows us to specify a String array containing the keys that we want to be included.</p>
  <p>The <code>@DataProvider</code> will change as follows:</p>

  <pre data-src="../sample-files/excelDataProvider-sample7.java"></pre>

  <p>In this case the SimpleExcelDataprovider will go through all the rows and return only the ones which have keys in the
    array of keys that we have provided i.e. rows 'a', 'c' and 'd'</p>
