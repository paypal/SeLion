        How to tap into events generated by WebDriver using SeLion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>WebDriver events are primarily those events which are related to some action that Selenium WebDriver performs on
        the
        web page or on a native application such as "click" (or) "type" etc., Selenium's answer to tapping into such
        events
        is via the <a
                href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/events/EventFiringWebDriver.html"><code>EventFiringWebDriver</code>.</a>
        But there are a couple of issues with using the <code>EventFiringWebDriver</code>.
    <ol>
        <li>It does not work with <a
                href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html">Actions</a>
        </li>
        <li>Selenium dev community are likely to deprecate this class out of the Core libraries and perhaps house it
            outside of Selenium
            in a maybe different form.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started with Event Handling in SeLion</h2>

    <p>
        SeLion offers support to tap into events that are generated by WebDriver (including the ones that originate from
        the <code>Actions</code> class) in a different way. The below listed steps can be followed to start tapping into WebDriver events using SeLion.
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new listener class by implementing the SeLion exposed interface <code>com.paypal.selion.platform.grid.EventListener</code>.
            A sample listener can look like below
            <pre data-src="../sample-files/MyEventListener.java"></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Provide the fully qualified class name of your listener either via </li>
        <ol>
            <li>The JVM argument <code>SELENIUM_WEBDRIVER_EVENT_LISTENER</code> (or)</li>
            <li>As a TestNG suite file parameter <code>webDriverEventListener</code>.
                A sample could look like below:
                <pre><code class="language-sh">&lt;parameter name="webDriverEventListener" value="qa.tests.MyEventListener"/&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>In case you have more than 1 such listener that you would want to plug into, then please provide them as
    comma separated values.
    </ol>
    With that you should now start being able to start tapping into all events that originate from the concrete implementations of <code>WebDriver</code>.
    The javadocs for <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/DriverCommand.html"><code>DriverCommand</code></a> 
should be a good place to start, to learn the set of commands that are supported by <code>WebDriver</code>.
